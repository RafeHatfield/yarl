PHASE 13C: SLOW ZOMBIE SPEED GATING ANALYSIS (50 runs each)
===========================================================

BASELINE (Player 0.25 speed vs Zombie 0.5 speed):
- Zombie is FASTER than player (0.5 > 0.25)
- Expected: Zombie gets bonus attacks, player does NOT

Results:
  Player Attacks: 318
  Player Hits: 244 (76.7%)
  Monster Attacks: 347
  Monster Hits: 95 (27.4%)
  **Bonus Attacks: 191** ← ZOMBIE getting bonus attacks!
  Player Wins: 50/50

FULL SPEED (Player 1.0 speed vs Zombie 0.5 speed):
- Player is FASTER than zombie (1.0 > 0.5)
- Expected: Player gets bonus attacks, zombie does NOT

Results:
  Player Attacks: 291
  Player Hits: 251 (86.3%)
  Monster Attacks: 171
  Monster Hits: 44 (25.7%)
  **Bonus Attacks: 0** ← NO bonus attacks at all!
  Player Wins: 50/50

CONCLUSION:
The baseline scenario confirms speed gating works for MONSTERS:
- Zombie (0.5) > Player (0.25) → Zombie gets 191 bonus attacks ✓

The full speed scenario reveals an issue:
- Player (1.0) > Zombie (0.5) → Player should get bonus attacks ✗
- But we see 0 bonus attacks!

HYPOTHESIS:
Equipment bonuses may not be applying correctly in scenario loading,
OR player speed calculation has a bug that prevents equipment from stacking.

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
1. Verify equipment bonuses are actually added to player speed_bonus_ratio
2. Check if scenario_level_loader properly equips items
3. Test manually to see actual player speed during scenario runs
