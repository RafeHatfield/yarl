Story Option 2: The Cursed Past (Sympathy for the Devil)
Concept
Ancient Prison, Hidden Tragedy: Long ago, a great evil (an ancient dragon) was lured into a trap and sealed in a prison outside time
tvtropes.org
. The Entity the player serves is actually this dragon – chained in the distant past by a powerful artifact. For ages he’s been unable to act directly (explaining why this legendary villain hasn’t rampaged in recent history
tvtropes.org
).
The Hero’s Dilemma: The Entity holds the hero’s soul in bondage and compels them to descend the cursed catacombs to retrieve the artifact (the Amulet of Yendor) that can free him. The hero undertakes this quest through countless deaths and runs, driven by the Entity’s command. Along the way, however, the player pieces together the truth: their master was not always a one-dimensional evil, but a proud being betrayed and trapped by ancient heroes. This emerging narrative fosters an unexpected sympathy for the “devil” as the player learns of his tragic fate, even while he remains an antagonistic force.
Slow-Burn Revelation: True to roguelike storytelling ideals, the lore is uncovered gradually via gameplay – cryptic clues, environmental details, and NPC hints – rather than expositional monologues. The Entity himself never outright reveals his past or identity until perhaps a slip in the final encounter, keeping the mystery intact until the player has put the pieces together.
The Entity (Big Bad)
Identity & Form: The Entity is an ancient dragon in human guise. Once a mighty tyrant of old, he was outwitted and bound by a curse to a far-off time. In the present, he appears only as a spectral overseer or a withered, humanoid form because the curse prevents him from accessing his true draconic body and power (essentially “wounded” or diminished, unable to assume dragon form).
Motivation: Above all, he seeks to regain the Amulet of Yendor, the very relic used to imprison him ages ago. With it, he can break the temporal curse and restore his full dragon form and freedom. Every scheme, every taunt to the hero is focused on this singular goal. Unlike a simple greed for another’s treasure, this is a quest for liberation – one that the player can understand, if not outright condone.
Personality: The Entity’s tone remains Alan Rickman-esque – sarcastic, aristocratic, and supremely confident. He is overbearing and dismissive of failure, often mocking the hero’s deaths. Importantly, he never betrays desperation or weakness in his words. He acts as if the hero’s efforts are merely a means to an end (which they are), and maintains a sincere, almost reasonable front when making promises. Any hints of his tragic backstory or true nature are left to the player’s inference until the climax. This consistency preserves his mystique and avoids out-of-character monologues, aligning with the game’s no-exposition philosophy.
The Guide
Identity: A ghostly guide accompanies the hero in the darkness – the lingering soul of a previous adventurer (or perhaps one of the ancient heroes who originally set the trap). This Guide manifests through environmental storytelling: carved murals, cryptic inscriptions, or ephemeral whispers that the player encounters as they delve. For instance, the walls might depict a great battle between a knight and a dragon, or a journal page might recount “…the beast’s roar as it vanished into the void, tricked by our divine ruse.” Such clues steadily unveil the history of the Entity without outright stating it.
Role in Story: The Guide provides subtle hints about the Entity’s weakness and the true stakes. Early on, the messages are mysterious (“...Only a dragon’s soul can replace another…” scratched on a stone tablet, for example). As the player survives more runs and descends deeper, the Guide’s warnings grow clearer – indicating that the Amulet of Yendor could break not only the Entity’s chains, but the hero’s as well. Crucially, the Guide never dumps exposition; the clues require player interpretation, rewarding discovery and curiosity.
Tone and Reliability: The Guide’s voice is cryptic but earnest. It never explicitly says “the Entity is a dragon” or “don’t trust him”; instead it might lament the “eternal guardian bound below” or urge the hero to “consider the cost of mercy.” This preserves ambiguity – the player isn’t sure if the Guide is fully benevolent or if they have their own agenda. Their hints simply nudge the hero toward realizing there may be alternative plans beyond obeying the Entity. By the final levels, an attentive player will have a strong suspicion of the Entity’s true nature and the impending pivotal choice.
Victory Condition Options
Option A – Single Ending (Simple Path):
Descend and Retrieve: The hero fights their way to the deepest floor (e.g. Level 25 of the catacombs) and finally claims the Amulet of Yendor, which has long anchored the Entity’s prison.
Final Confrontation (Choice): On attempting to leave with the Amulet, the Entity confronts the hero – appearing in ghostly form at the dungeon’s exit or speaking through the Amulet itself. There is no physical boss fight here, just a tense standoff. The Entity demands the artifact, promising the hero freedom or power in return. The player faces a binary choice: give the Amulet to the Entity, or keep it for themselves.
Give Amulet (Bad Ending): Trusting the Entity proves fatal. The moment the hero relinquishes the Amulet, the Entity uses its power to break his curse – and in the same breath, binds the hero in his place. In a cruel twist, the player’s character is imprisoned in the distant past as the new anchor for the curse (a clever inversion of the promise to “make you a dragonkin”). The Entity is liberated and thanks the hero with a final mocking laugh as he walks free, leaving the player to an eternal fate. This is a failure ending, illustrating the trope that ancient evils never reward those who free them
tvtropes.org
.
Keep Amulet (Good Ending): Defying the Entity, the hero uses the Amulet’s power to sever the soul contract, freeing themselves from the Entity’s control. We see the hero escape the dungeon, Amulet in hand, while the Entity – still bound by the curse – can only rage helplessly. The player wins: they’ve regained their soul and the Entity remains sealed. It’s a hard-earned escape ending (and effectively the “true victory” for this storyline). The game could end on the Entity’s furious, echoing vow that this isn’t over, leaving room for a sequel or post-victory content.
Option B – Multiple Endings (Expanded Narrative):
In a more elaborate design, the final encounter can branch into several outcomes beyond the simple give/keep choice. These multiple endings reward player decision-making and moral interpretation, allowing the story to unfold in different ways:
Escape & Freedom (Defy the Devil): The hero outright refuses the Entity’s deal and might even find a way to turn the Amulet against him. For example, using knowledge from the Guide, the hero performs a ritual to reinforce the dragon’s prison or attempts to banish the Entity entirely. In this ending, the hero succeeds in outsmarting the Entity, using the Amulet to break their own bonds and perhaps “lock the door” behind them. The Entity remains trapped for eternity, and the hero ascends to freedom with their soul intact. This is the ultimate good ending, giving the player a satisfying sense of triumph and closure.
False Alliance – Dragonkin’s Curse: The hero is tempted by the Entity’s sincere-sounding offer to share power. If the player chooses to give the Amulet willingly, the Entity appears genuinely grateful and, true to his word, grants the hero a taste of draconic power – a moment of triumph quickly overturned by tragedy. This act fulfills an ancient failsafe of the curse: only a dragon can replace a dragon. By accepting the boon, the hero unwittingly becomes “dragon-kin,” a suitable substitute to take the Entity’s place in the prison. The Entity swaps places in an instant, emerging fully free while the hero is left trapped in the time-cage he occupied. It’s a devastating twist ending (the Entity might even offer a sardonic apology as the trap springs). The player essentially chose to trust the devil and got their wish twisted against them
tvtropes.org
 – a classic outcome where ambition and naiveté lead to doom. (Note: This ending is a narrative failure state, but a compelling one. The Entity remains free in the world, and the game could even roll credits as he regains his strength.)
Mercy & Betrayal – The Sympathetic Devil: If the game includes a fight with the Entity’s weakened human form at the end, the hero can prevail in combat and bring the Entity to his knees. At this point, the player faces a moral choice: finish the weakened villain, or show mercy and use the Amulet to free him from his suffering. Should the hero, moved by sympathy, decide to return the Entity’s power (for instance, handing over the Amulet or dispelling the ward keeping him human), the outcome is an unexpected anti-climax. The Entity transforms into his true dragon form, finally unbound. In a terrifying final moment, this colossal dragon effortlessly strikes down the hero, who is now hopelessly outmatched. The game presents this as a legitimate (if tragic) ending: the player “won” the battle and freed the villain, only to be immediately destroyed by the very being they pitied. This highlights the theme that showing mercy to an ancient evil can backfire
tvtropes.org
. It’s an intended unwinnable scenario – the hero’s compassionate choice leads to their demise, underscoring the narrative’s moral complexity. (Aside: The fight with the fully powered dragon is essentially impossible to win in normal play – an overwhelming encounter meant as a narrative full stop. Only the most overprepared or clever players might ever find a way to survive it, which could be an ultra-secret ending in its own right.)
Sacrifice & Redemption: As a hidden or “heroic” ending, the hero realizes that neither taking the Amulet for themselves nor giving it to the Entity is truly right. Instead, in a bold move, they choose to destroy the Amulet of Yendor at the climax. This selfless act has far-reaching consequences: by shattering the artifact, all soul bindings are broken – not only freeing the hero from the Entity, but also releasing the spirits of countless other victims bound by the curse. The Entity howls as the pillars of his prison begin to crumble. He either remains forever trapped in the collapsing temporal void or is weakened enough to be defeated for good. The hero, having freed the world from the cycle, likely makes the ultimate sacrifice as well: they might be caught in the destruction or rendered mortal (losing their resurrection ability). This ending is bittersweet and heroic. It provides closure to the curse at the cost of the protagonist’s own future – a fitting roguelike narrative capstone for players who reject both the villain’s bargain and personal escape in favor of the greater good.
The Plan (Emergent Narrative Delivery)
Gradual Discovery: Throughout the dungeon crawl, the Guide’s clues gradually reveal the larger plan and backstory. Early levels hint that the catacombs were built not as a mere treasure vault but as a binding chamber for a great evil. Mid-game clues reveal references to time manipulation and a dragon’s fury, hinting at the Entity’s true identity and the trap laid for him. By the final levels, the player should understand that the Amulet of Yendor is both key and lock – it’s how the ancient people trapped the dragon, and now the Entity needs it to break free.
Player Agency in Lore: In line with roguelike best practices, all of this lore is optional and player-driven. A player who just wants to “dive and fight” can ignore the murals and notes, while a curious player is rewarded with vital context. This ensures the story enhances but doesn’t interrupt gameplay. By design, the narrative emerges from exploration: each piece of information might only make complete sense after multiple runs or upon reflection, fostering an ongoing mystery and discovery element.
Foreshadowing the Endings: The game drops subtle foreshadows for the various possible endings:
Legends speak of “a devil who twists the wishes of those who seek to free it”
tvtropes.org
 – warning clever players that handing over the artifact or trusting the Entity could end badly.
An inscription of the ancient hero’s creed: “Let mercy be our sin, for we could not kill the beast” – foreshadowing both the original decision to imprison (instead of kill) and the potential mistake of showing mercy again now
tvtropes.org
.
Notes from the previous doomed adventurer detailing how they planned to use the Amulet to break their own bond, hinting that the player can do the same (escape ending or sacrifice).
A prophecy mural showing two dragons balanced on a scale, suggesting the “only a dragon can contain a dragon” trick, which eagle-eyed players might interpret as a trap mechanism for the dragonkin ending.
No Villain Monologues: Importantly, the Entity never explicates these plot points himself. He remains in-character – taunting, cajoling, or threatening as needed, but never telling the hero why he wants the Amulet beyond vague statements of its “importance.” This restraint avoids the dreaded exposition dump. The moment he comes closest to revealing the truth might be just before the final choice or during the final boss fight (e.g., a triumphant “At last, I shall be free of these mortal shackles!” that suddenly makes the player realize what’s truly at stake). By then, it’s likely too late for the hero to turn back, heightening the drama.
Integration with Gameplay
Permadeath and Time Loop: The permadeath mechanic is woven into the narrative – each time the hero dies, the Entity snatches their soul and thrusts them into a new body to continue the mission. This explains why the player can try over and over; the hero is effectively trapped in the Entity’s service until they succeed or find another way out. It also means the hero shares a taste of being trapped in a cycle, paralleling the dragon’s own imprisonment (a thematic connection that can build sympathy). Death is not the end but part of the story, akin to how Hades handles repeated runs as canon.
Emergent Lore on Each Run: To encourage exploration and replay, certain clues or story bits might only appear after the hero has died a few times or reached new depths (e.g., the ghost Guide reveals a new hint on the next run, or deeper murals are only accessible after certain bosses). This piecemeal revelation across multiple runs means the **full story is only understood after several attempts】, matching roguelike gameplay where players improve knowledge over time. The story thus becomes a reward for persistence, not a one-time info dump.
Non-Linear Exploration: The dungeon could have some branching paths or secret rooms that contain extra lore (for example, a hidden library level with records of the ancient battle). This allows optional story engagement – players who want the narrative can seek these out, while others can skip them. It avoids linear storytelling by making lore discovery a part of exploration.
Dynamic NPC Interactions: If there are NPCs or merchants between runs (say, back at a base or camp), their dialogue can gradually reflect the hero’s unfolding discovery. For instance, an old scholar NPC might start connecting the signs: “These runes you reported… they remind me of a saga about a dragon and a time spell…” Such interactions stay short and optional, ensuring they enhance rather than interrupt the roguelike flow.
Final Choice Mechanics: The endgame decision is presented clearly but without obvious “good/bad” labels. The choices (e.g., [Give Amulet], [Use Amulet on self], [Destroy Amulet], [Spare Entity]) are worded in-character. The consequences are left for the player to experience, not telegraphed with color-coding or lengthy explanation (maintaining that sense of uncertainty and weight behind each choice). Once the choice is made, the gameplay shifts appropriately: a cutscene or final boss fight triggers based on the decision. Even the “unwinnable” fight in the mercy ending is a gameplay moment – the player can struggle and truly feel the dragon’s overwhelming power before the inevitable defeat.
Tone & Player Experience
Sympathetic Yet Menacing: This storyline walks a fine line between dark fantasy tragedy and wry, dark humor. The Entity’s sardonic commentary keeps the tone from becoming overly grim. He might crack a biting joke when the hero dies (“Do try not to explode this time; it’s getting monotonous,” he drawls upon the player’s revival, in that Alan Rickman tone). These moments add a Princess Bride-like levity even as the underlying stakes are deadly serious.
Emotional Undercurrent: As the player uncovers the Entity’s past, a surprising emotional depth emerges. The theme of imprisonment and freedom resonates through every layer of the story – the hero’s repeated deaths, the souls bound in the dungeon, and the dragon’s centuries-long captivity. Players may find themselves feeling pity for the very tyrant who has been tormenting them run after run. This doesn’t redeem the villain (he stays evil and selfish to the end
tvtropes.org
), but it gives him a poignant dimension. By the final act, the player’s understanding of the Entity is mixed with empathy, making the tough choices even more impactful.
No Black-and-White Morality: Each ending reinforces that this is not a simple good vs evil tale. If the player takes the easy deal, they suffer a cruel fate. If they show compassion, it is tragically betrayed. If they act purely in self-interest (escape), they save themselves but leave the world with an undying threat still locked away (perhaps to be someone else’s problem). And if they sacrifice everything, it’s a bittersweet victory at heavy cost. These outcomes solidify the game’s narrative as one of meaningful choices and consequences, avoiding any overly predictable hero tropes. The tone remains meaningful but not utterly dour – there’s always a streak of irony or dark comedy (for example, the Entity’s snide remarks, or the fact that the “reward” for mercy is instant death, which is grimly comedic in a meta sense).
Consistency with Roguelike Feel: Despite the deeper lore, the game maintains a fast-paced, player-driven feel. There are no long cutscenes; the story elements are woven into gameplay. The player can laugh at the Entity’s insults in one moment and then feel a pang of remorse for him in the next, mirroring the mix of tones found in games like Hades (witty banter amid family tragedy). The end result is a story that enriches the roguelike loop without hijacking it. Players who invest in the narrative will discover a memorable tale of a dragon’s curse and a doomed hero, while those who don’t will simply experience a series of challenging runs with an entertainingly snarky antagonist in the background. Either way, the game delivers on fun and intrigue – striking that ideal balance of dry humor and real stakes that we set out to achieve.
By reintroducing the “sympathy for the devil” element, this version of the story ensures the Big Bad is more than just a hurdle. He is an integral part of the game’s appeal – at times an oppressive master, at times a tragic figure. The player’s evolving relationship with the Entity, from begrudging servitude to understanding and ultimately to a final choice, lies at the heart of the experience. All of it is achieved through emergent, player-discovered storytelling, making the narrative as roguelike as the gameplay itself. In the end, whether the hero condemns the dragon, frees him, or perishes, the journey leaves a lasting impression – a blend of mystery, consequence, and a touch of dark comedy that players will talk about long after escaping the Catacombs of Yendor.
