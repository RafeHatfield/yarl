---

## 📋 **What Was Just Completed**

### Phase 5: The Six Endings ✅

- `screens/grief_rage_cutscene.py` - Ending 5 transformation cutscene
- `config/endings.yaml` - All ending dialogue and cutscene text
- `engine_integration.py` - Cutscene hooks

**Tests Fixed:**
- RenderSystem FOV parameters (game state mock)
- Reveal-map with start-level (explored tiles validation)
- Portal spawn inventory mock
- Level 25 generation (already passing)

**Documentation Created:**
- `PHASE5_SESSION_COMPLETE.md` - Full session summary
- `PHASE5_TESTING_PLAN.md` - Updated with completion status

## 🎯 **What's Next: TWO Strategic Paths**

### **🏆 Path A: Complete Story Arc (RECOMMENDED)**

We've completed Phases 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Victory Condition story! 

**Next immediate priorities:**

1. **Phase 4: Environmental Lore** (2-3 weeks) ← **START HERE**
   - Add ending-specific lore to signposts
   - Create murals/inscriptions with backstory
   - Easter eggs for deep players
   - Reference: `VICTORY_CONDITION_PHASES.md` Phase 4

2. **Phase 7: The Assassins** (2-3 weeks after Phase 4)
   - Add urgency/tension to ending choice
   - Turn counter, assassin spawns if delayed
   - Reinforces Entity's impatience

3. **Portal System** (4-6 weeks)
   - LEGENDARY feature - "Wand of Portals"
   - Tactical gameplay like Portal the game
   - Creates emergent strategies
   - Community will love this
   - Reference: `VICTORY_CONDITION_PHASES.md` Portal Mechanics

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks to complete story arc + legendary system

---

### **🎮 Path B: Core Roguelike Systems (From ROADMAP.md)**

If you prefer traditional roguelike depth before polish:

1. **Item Identification System** (2 weeks)
   - THE defining roguelike mechanic
   - Players discover what unknown potions/scrolls do
   - Difficulty scaling (Easy=80% pre-ID, Hard=5% pre-ID)
   - Reference: `TRADITIONAL_ROGUELIKE_FEATURES.md`

2. **Item Stacking** (1 week)
   - "5x Healing Potion" instead of 5 separate items

3. **Scroll/Potion Variety** (2 weeks)
   - Expand from 8 to 20 scrolls, 15+ potions

4. **Resistance System** (2 weeks)
   - Fire/cold/poison/electric resistances on equipment

5. **Throwing System** (1 week)
   - Throw potions/daggers in combat

### **📊 Quick Comparison**

| Aspect | Path A (Story) | Path B (Mechanics) |
|--------|---|---|
| **Narrative Depth** | ✅✅✅ Complete | ❌ On hold |
| **Gameplay Innovation** | ✅✅ (Portals) | ✅✅✅ (ID System) |
| **Time to "Wow"** | 2-3 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| **Community Impact** | Story lovers | Roguelike fans |
| **Effort Level** | Medium | Medium |
| **Risk Level** | Low (story polish) | Low (core systems) |

**Recommendation:** Path A completes what you started with Phases 1-5, then Path B systems can enhance the core gameplay loop.

## 💡 **Architecture Overview (5-Minute Read)**

### **High-Level Structure**
```
engine/
├── game_engine.py       → Main loop + system coordination
├── game_state_manager.py → Player/map/entities state
├── systems/             → Rendering, AI, pathfinding, effects
└── turn_manager.py      → Turn processing, queue management

screens/                 → UI screens (menus, dialogues, cutscenes)
components/             → Game object properties (fighter, inventory, etc.)
config/                 → Data-driven configs (YAML + Python)
```

### **Key Systems**
- **ECS-style:** Entity has components (Fighter, Inventory, Level, etc.)
- **State Machine:** Game state tracks current screen (PLAYERS_TURN, MENU, DIALOGUE, etc.)
- **YAML-Driven:** All entities, items, levels configured via YAML
- **Save/Load:** JSON serialization of all state

### **Data-Driven Configs**
- `config/entities.yaml` - Monsters, weapons, armor, NPCs
- `config/level_templates.yaml` - Dungeon layouts
- `config/endings.yaml` - Dialogue and cutscenes
- `config/guide_dialogue.yaml` - NPC interactions
- `config/game_constants.py` - Balance tuning

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Quality Assurance**

- **Test Command:** `make test` or `pytest`
- **Test Coverage:** 2432 passing tests across 200+ test files
- **Critical Tests:** Phase 5 end-to-end flows in `tests/test_phase5_critical_paths.py`
- **Pre-Commit:** Tests run automatically, must pass before commit

## 🎮 **Quick Play Testing**

```bash
# Standard game
python3 engine.py

# Test with cheats (god mode, fast level jump, full map reveal)
python3 engine.py --testing --start-level 25 --god-mode --reveal-map

# Level 20 for testing knowledge unlocking
python3 engine.py --testing --start-level 20 --god-mode --reveal-map
```

## 📚 **Essential Documentation**

- **ROADMAP.md** - Overall development priorities and timeline
- **TRADITIONAL_ROGUELIKE_FEATURES.md** - Design specs for each system
- **VICTORY_CONDITION_PHASES.md** - Phase 5 breakdown (currently complete)
- **PHASE5_SESSION_COMPLETE.md** - What was just completed
- **PHASE5_TESTING_PLAN.md** - All 6 endings testing procedures

---

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls for New Session**

1. **Bytecode Cache Issues** - Delete `__pycache__` folders if changes not reflecting
2. **YAML Changes** - Reload configs after editing YAML files (restart engine)
3. **Test Isolation** - Some tests modify testing config; check `setup_method()` resets
4. **Entity Factory** - All entity creation goes through `EntityFactory`, don't hardcode
5. **State Machine** - Game state affects what input handlers are active; check `GameStates`
