# Demo Scripts

This directory contains demonstration scripts that showcase various game systems and features. These are development tools and examples, not part of the core game.

## Available Demos

### **System Demonstrations**
- `demo_asset_management.py` - Asset loading and management system examples
- `demo_event_system.py` - Event bus and pattern system demonstrations  
- `demo_input_system.py` - Input handling and mapping examples
- `demo_rendering_abstraction.py` - Rendering system abstraction examples

### **Performance & Optimization**
- `demo_performance_profiling.py` - Performance profiling and benchmarking tools
- `demo_memory_optimization.py` - Memory management and optimization examples

### **Debugging & Logging**
- `demo_combat_logging.py` - Combat system logging and debugging examples

## Usage

These demos can be run independently to explore specific systems:

```bash
# Example: Run performance profiling demo
python examples/demos/demo_performance_profiling.py

# Example: Test event system patterns
python examples/demos/demo_event_system.py
```

## Development Notes

- These files are kept for reference and development purposes
- They demonstrate best practices for using various game systems
- Some may require specific setup or configuration to run
- They are not included in the main game distribution

## Integration with Main Game

While these are standalone demos, they often use the same systems as the main game and can serve as:
- **Learning examples** for new developers
- **Testing tools** for system validation
- **Benchmarking utilities** for performance analysis
- **Reference implementations** for complex features
