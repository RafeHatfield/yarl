PHASE 13B: SPEED BUILD ANALYSIS (50 runs each)
==============================================

ATTACK FREQUENCY:
                 Baseline  Light(25%)  Full(75%)
Player Attacks:  261       254         257
Monster Attacks: 173       160         172

→ Light speed reduced monster attacks by 7.5%
→ Full speed showed minimal reduction (0.6%)

HIT RATES:
                 Baseline  Light(25%)  Full(75%)
Player Hit %:    69.0%     72.8%       71.2%
Monster Hit %:   44.5%     35.0%       39.0%

→ Light speed improved player accuracy by 3.8%
→ Light speed reduced monster accuracy by 9.5%
→ Full speed showed smaller improvements

BONUS ATTACKS:
All scenarios: 0 bonus attacks

EXPLANATION:
- Bonus attacks require player speed > opponent speed
- Orc has default speed_bonus ≈ 1.0
- Even with speed items (1.25 or 1.75 total), threshold not met
- Need slower opponents (troll: 0.5, zombie: 0.75) to trigger

CONCLUSION:
Speed items show subtle but measurable impact on combat pacing:
✓ Fewer monster attacks (enemy gets fewer turns)
✓ Higher player hit rates
✓ Lower monster hit rates

To measure bonus attacks, Phase 13C should test vs slower enemies.
