PHASE 13D: BUG FIX RESULTS (50 runs each)
==========================================

BEFORE FIX:
-----------
Baseline (Player 0.25 vs Zombie 0.5):
  Bonus Attacks: 191 (zombie attacks)
  
Full Speed (Player 1.0 vs Zombie 0.5):
  Bonus Attacks: 0 (BROKEN - player should get bonus attacks)

AFTER FIX:
----------
Baseline (Player 0.25 vs Zombie 0.5):
  Bonus Attacks: 194 (zombie attacks - still working ✓)
  Player Attacks: 323
  Monster Attacks: 337
  
Full Speed (Player 1.0 vs Zombie 0.5):
  Bonus Attacks: 132 (PLAYER attacks - NOW WORKING! ✓)
  Player Attacks: 287
  Monster Attacks: 79 (much fewer - player dominates with momentum)

COMPARISON:
-----------
Baseline → Full Speed impact:
  - Bonus attacks: 0 → 132 (player momentum working!)
  - Player attacks: 323 → 287 (slightly fewer needed)
  - Monster attacks: 337 → 79 (76% reduction!)
  - Player hit rate: 75.5% → 85.7% (10% improvement)
  - Monster hit rate: 28.5% → 26.6% (minimal change)

KEY INSIGHT:
Player with full speed stack (1.0) vs slow zombie (0.5):
- Gets 132 bonus attacks in 50 duels (~2.6 per duel)
- Dramatically reduces enemy attack opportunities (337 → 79)
- Combat ends much faster with sustained momentum

THE BUG:
--------
Scenario harness was calling attack_d20() directly without checking
for bonus attacks. The bonus attack logic only existed in game_actions.py
which scenarios bypass.

THE FIX:
--------
Added bonus attack check to scenario_harness.py:
- After each player attack, check if player is faster than target
- If yes, roll for bonus attack using SpeedBonusTracker
- Execute bonus attack and record metrics

Equipment bonuses were applying correctly all along!
