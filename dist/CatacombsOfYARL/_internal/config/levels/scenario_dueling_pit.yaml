# Scenario: Dueling Pit - Baseline Combat Feel
# Purpose: Measure baseline combat feel (accuracy, evasion, momentum) in 1v1 duels
# Phase 13A: Combat metrics scaffolding
#
# This scenario provides a clean measurement environment for:
#   - Attack attempt rates
#   - Hit/miss percentages (player vs monster)
#   - Combat pacing (turns per kill)
#   - Speed bonus effectiveness
#
# We're NOT tuning numbers here; we're building the measurement infrastructure
# to inform future tuning decisions.

# Defaults for harness runs
defaults:
  turn_limit: 100
  player_bot: "tactical_fighter"

# Expected outcomes for validation
# These are conservative thresholds - we want to ensure the scenario runs,
# not enforce strict combat balance (that comes later).
# Base expectations: 5 test runs yielded 5 kills, 0 deaths (100% win rate at depth 5)
# For 50 runs, we expect roughly even win/loss distribution as player/monster are similar strength
# Thresholds set to catch regressions while allowing natural RNG variance
expected:
  min_player_kills: 15            # ~30% minimum win rate across runs (very conservative)
  max_player_deaths: 40           # Allow up to 80% loss rate (very conservative)

# Dungeon depth (affects monster stats)
depth: 5
