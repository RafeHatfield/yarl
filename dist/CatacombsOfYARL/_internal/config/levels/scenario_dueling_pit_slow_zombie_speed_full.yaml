# Scenario: Dueling Pit - Slow Zombie (Full Speed)
# Purpose: Measure bonus attack frequency with full speed stack vs slow opponent
# Phase 13C: Testing speed gating and momentum mechanics
#
# This scenario tests combat vs a SLOW enemy (zombie, 0.5 speed_bonus).
# Player has FULL speed stack: 0.25 (base) + 0.75 (equipment) = 1.0 total.
# Expected: Player speed (1.0) > zombie speed (0.5), so BONUS ATTACKS SHOULD TRIGGER!
#
# This validates the speed gating condition and measures:
#   - Bonus attack frequency with 1.0 speed vs 0.5 speed opponent
#   - Impact of bonus attacks on combat pacing
#   - Turns to kill with sustained momentum
#
# Equipment:
#   - Quickfang Dagger (+0.25 speed)
#   - Boots of Swiftness (+0.25 speed)
#   - Ring of Hummingbird (+0.25 speed)
#   - Player base speed: 0.25
#   - Total: 1.0 speed_bonus
#
# Zombie stats:
#   - speed_bonus: 0.5 (slow zombie)
#   - HP: 25
#   - Low accuracy (1), no evasion (0)
