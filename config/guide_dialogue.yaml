# Guide Dialogue System
#
# The Guide: The previous "champion" in the Entity's soul rotation
# 
# Backstory (The True Horror):
#   - Entity has captured multiple souls over the centuries
#   - Each soul gets put in a new body, sent down to retrieve the amulet
#   - When you die, Entity resets you in a new body to try again
#   - Guide was the LONGEST-LASTING attempt - survived many runs
#   - Eventually Entity gave up on them, discarded their soul
#   - Now stuck as a ghost, watching the new souls (like the player) try
#   - Player is just the latest soul in the rotation
#   
# Key Revelations:
#   - You're already trapped (your soul was captured long ago)
#   - Death isn't real death - Entity just resets you
#   - Guide lasted longest but still "failed" in Entity's eyes
#   - Amulet is what Entity NEEDS (escape? healing? transformation?)
#   - Purpose is deliberately vague - hints but no certainty
#
# Personality: Grumpy, sarcastic, "cranky mentor" vibes
#   - Tired of watching new souls make the same mistakes
#   - Not above slapping your hand (metaphorically) 
#   - Somber and serious, but with biting wit
#   - Bitter about being discarded after lasting so long
#   - Respects player agency but thinks they're doomed too
#
# Phase 3: Progressive backstory reveals at camp encounters
# Phase 5: Can be expanded with multiple endings integration

# Guide encounters at specific levels (in camp rooms)
encounters:
  # Level 5 - First Warning

          body, same soul. Sound familiar?'*
          
          The ghost crosses its arms irritably.
          
          *'I lasted longer than most. Decades of runs. But eventually, the dragon
          got bored waiting for me to succeed. Threw me away like a broken tool.
          Now I'm stuck here watching the NEW guy.'*
          
          The figure gestures vaguely at the dungeon around you.
          
          *'Why do you think there's so much gear just lying around down here, anyway?
          All those swords and armor? Those were MINE. And the souls before me. And

          already trapped - has been for who knows how long. The dragon needs that
          amulet [PLACEHOLDER] at the bottom. For what? Hell if I know. Escape,
          maybe. Transformation. Healing. It's vague on the details.'*
          
          The figure snorts.
          
          *'But here's what I DO know: it'll keep throwing you at the problem until
          you succeed or it gets bored. I tried for DECADES. Never made it. Eventually
          it gave up on me and got someone new. That's you, by the way. Congratulations.'*

          *'I... it's... the voice...'*
          
          The figure flickers violently, struggling to maintain shape.
          
          *'Can't... hold... much longer...'*
