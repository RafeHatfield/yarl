# Scenario: Oath of Venom Identity
# Purpose: Verify that Oath of Venom measurably changes combat outcomes
# Phase 22.1: Run Identity via Oaths
#
# This scenario demonstrates:
#   - Oath of Venom selection and application
#   - 25% chance to apply poison on successful hits
#   - Poison damage contribution to total damage output
#   - Deterministic execution under seed_base=1337

# Expected outcomes for validation
# Phase 22.1.2: Increased enemy count (5 orcs) for higher signal
# With Oath of Venom, player should apply poison to multiple enemies
# Focus-fire reward (duration extensions) should be measurable
expected:
  min_player_kills: 3            # Should kill at least 3/5 enemies
  max_player_deaths: 1           # May die occasionally (5 enemies is pressure)

# Dungeon depth (affects monster stats)
depth: 5

# Monster placements - multiple weak enemies for poison demonstration
# Phase 22.1.2: Increased enemy count for higher signal (5 orcs vs 3)
# Bernoulli proc (25%) needs sufficient hit opportunities for stable metrics
# Also tests focus-fire reward (duration extensions on re-proc)
monsters:
  # Five orcs spaced for sequential combat (higher signal)
