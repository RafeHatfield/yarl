# Scenario: Orc Swarm - Brutal (Baseline)
# Purpose: Measure baseline survivability when badly outnumbered (5 orcs).
#
# This scenario ups the ante from the standard swarm (3 orcs) to create
# a much harsher multi-enemy encounter. The goal is to observe survival curves
# and combat metrics under extreme pressure without speed advantages.
