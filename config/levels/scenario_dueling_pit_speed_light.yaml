# Scenario: Dueling Pit - Light Speed Build
# Purpose: Measure impact of single speed item on combat feel
# Phase 13B: Speed-focused dueling scenarios
#
# This scenario tests a "light" speed build with ONE speed item (25% bonus).
# We compare this to the baseline dueling_pit to measure:
#   - Bonus attack frequency
#   - Hit rate changes with momentum
#   - Combat pacing with speed advantage
#
# Equipment changes from baseline:
#   - Quickfang Dagger (25% speed bonus) instead of regular dagger
#   - Same armor (leather_armor)
#   - No speed rings/boots

# Defaults for harness runs
defaults:
  turn_limit: 100
  player_bot: "tactical_fighter"
  allow_player_death: true

# Expected outcomes for validation
# Very conservative thresholds - we expect player to do somewhat better than baseline
# due to bonus attacks, but not trying to gate tuning tightly yet.
# Baseline dueling_pit: ~50/50 player wins in 50 runs
# Light speed: expect player to win ~60-70% due to 25% bonus attack chance
expected:
  min_player_kills: 25            # Player should win at least half the duels (conservative)
  max_player_deaths: 30           # Allow up to 60% loss rate (very loose)
