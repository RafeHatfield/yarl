# Scenario: Dueling Pit - Full Speed Build
# Purpose: Measure impact of stacked speed items on combat feel
# Phase 13B: Speed-focused dueling scenarios
#
# This scenario tests a "full" speed build with multiple speed items (75% total bonus).
# We compare this to the baseline and light speed builds to measure:
#   - Maximum bonus attack frequency with speed stacking
#   - Hit rate changes with sustained momentum
#   - Combat pacing with significant speed advantage
#
# Equipment changes from baseline:
#   - Quickfang Dagger (25% speed bonus)
#   - Boots of Swiftness (25% speed bonus)
#   - Ring of Hummingbird (25% speed bonus)
#   - Total: 75% speed bonus (additive stacking)
#   - Same armor (leather_armor)

# Expected outcomes for validation
# Very conservative thresholds - we expect player to win most duels with 75% speed bonus
# due to frequent bonus attacks and sustained momentum.
# Baseline dueling_pit: ~50/50 player wins in 50 runs
# Full speed: expect player to win ~80-90% due to 75% bonus attack chance
expected:
  min_player_kills: 30            # Player should win at least 60% of duels (conservative)
  max_player_deaths: 30           # Allow up to 60% loss rate (very loose, but expect fewer)
