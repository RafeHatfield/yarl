# Scenario: Orc Swarm - Brutal (Full Speed)
# Purpose: Measure impact of full speed stack on survivability in a brutal 5-orc swarm.
#
# Uses the same brutal swarm layout as baseline but equips the player with the
# full speed kit to observe how much speed/momentum improves survival in dire situations.
