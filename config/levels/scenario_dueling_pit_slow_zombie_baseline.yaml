# Scenario: Dueling Pit - Slow Zombie (Baseline)
# Purpose: Measure baseline momentum/bonus attacks vs slow opponent
# Phase 13C: Testing speed gating with slow enemies
#
# This scenario tests combat vs a SLOW enemy (zombie, 0.5 speed_bonus).
# Player has baseline kit with 0.25 speed_bonus.
# Expected: Player speed (0.25) is NOT > zombie speed (0.5), so NO bonus attacks.
#
# This validates the speed gating condition:
#   if attacker_speed <= defender_speed: no momentum building
#
# Equipment:
#   - Regular dagger (no speed bonus)
#   - Leather armor
#   - Player base speed: 0.25 (from initialization)
#
# Zombie stats:
#   - speed_bonus: 0.5 (slow zombie)
#   - HP: 25
#   - Low accuracy (1), no evasion (0)

# Defaults for harness runs
defaults:

# Expected outcomes for validation
# Very conservative - zombie is slow and weak, player should dominate
# But we're not gating balance tightly yet
expected:
  min_player_kills: 25            # Player should win at least half (very conservative)
  max_player_deaths: 25           # Allow losses for RNG variance
