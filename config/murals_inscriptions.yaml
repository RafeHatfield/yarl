# Murals & Inscriptions Configuration
#
# This file defines examinable wall murals and ancient inscriptions throughout the dungeon.
# These provide environmental storytelling about the Entity's backstory and the ritual.
#
# Mural Types:
#   - mural: Visual depiction of a scene (gold-tinted walls, visual descriptions)
#   - inscription: Carved text into stone (written messages, scholarly records)
#
# Depth Filtering:
#   Murals can optionally specify min_depth and/or max_depth to only appear
#   on certain dungeon levels. Deeper levels have more detailed lore.

      A vast mural depicts an ancient citadel being carved from living stone.
      Hooded figures work methodically, their faces obscured. Runes glow
      faintly around the construction. The scene conveys obsessive preparation
      for something momentous. At the mural's edge, two shapes loom in the sky—
      winged silhouettes, barely sketched.

      Carved in archaic script, worn by centuries:
      "Here stands the Citadel of the Crimson Order.
      We seek what immortals possess.
      We will have it."

      A faded mural shows hooded ritualists arranging objects in geometric
      patterns. Torches burn at cardinal points. In the center lies a massive
      circle inscribed with symbols that seem to writhe even in stone.
      The craftsmanship is exceptional—every detail obsessively precise.
      Centuries of dust coat the image, but the intent remains clear:
      this was meant to endure.

      Scratched hastily into stone, in different hands than the formal carvings:
      "Don't go deeper. The ritual is still active.
      Bodies don't stay buried here. They get taken."

      A breathtaking mural portrays two massive dragons in flight. They are
      rendered in gold and silver leaf, their wings spread wide. They fly
      together across an expansive sky, circling ancient mountains. Below them,
      small cities and forests stretch out. The dragons move with perfect
      synchronization, bonded. Their eyes glow with intelligence. Whoever
      carved this understood dragon nature intimately—or worshipped them.

      Ritualists work methodically, year after year rendered in sequential
      panels. In early scenes, they study books and artifacts. Middle panels
      show construction: raising walls, inscribing circles. Later scenes depict
      scholars pointing at scrolls, intense debate frozen in stone. The final
      panel shows them standing at the ritual ground, arms raised, ready.
      Each figure's face shows absolute determination. This was their life's work.

      Written in scholarly hand, precise and academic:
      "The dragon's immortal power resides in the Ruby Heart.
      Binding ritual: attraction → capture → completion.
      One dragon, perfectly prepared. Nothing can stop this."

      A golden dragon descends on the ritual ground, wings spread, magnificent.
      Then: the circle ignites. Binding runes explode with light. The dragon
      writhes, trapped. The ritualists circle it, chanting. The next panel shows
      the dragon falling, weakening. The final panel: only a crystalline Ruby Heart
      remains, glowing on the stone. The muralists rendered the dragon's face
      with astonishing detail—noble, powerful, tragically beautiful.

      Triumphant script, exuberant and bold:
      "AURELYN IS BOUND.
      AURELYN IS BROKEN.
      THE RUBY HEART IS OURS.
      TODAY, IMMORTALITY. TOMORROW, THE WORLD."

      A second dragon, darker and more terrible than the first, descends on
      the ritual ground in blind rage. Claws rake across stone. Fire erupts.
      Ritualists scatter, falling. The dragon's face is contorted with grief
      and fury—a heartbreak rendered in such detail that the stone itself
      seems to scream. In the next panel: the dragon is surrounded by binding
      runes, but something is wrong. The ritual doesn't complete. Incomplete
      circles glow with unstable power. The dragon transforms—scales recede,
      wings fold, the magnificent being collapses into human form.

      A human figure lies bound in glowing chains that don't quite fit.
      The runes are corrupted, flickering, barely holding. Around the figure,
      ritualists collapse from exhaustion. Many don't move at all. The binding
      worked—partially. The dragon is trapped. Zhyraxion is trapped. But the
      ritual failed to destroy him. Failed to extract his heart. Incomplete.
      The muralist left this scene deliberately rough, imperfect, unstable.

      Carved frantically, almost illegibly, by hands that shook:
      "ZHYRAXION. The dragon's name is ZHYRAXION.
      He is BOUND but not BROKEN.
      He will not die. He will not leave.
      We cannot kill what we have already half-destroyed.
      What do we do? WHAT DO WE DO?"

      A haunting mural shows the bound dragon reaching out with one hand.
      Around him, translucent figures appear—souls trapped in spectral form.
      Bodies appear and disappear in a cycle: the soul animates a body,
      descends the dungeon, returns dead, is replaced by another soul.
      The cycle is rendered over and over, spiraling down. Centuries rendered
      in repetition. The dragon stands at the center of this wheel, trapped,
      watching, waiting. His expression contains infinite despair.

      The deepest vault. Massive doors, sealed with ritual symbols. Guards
      stand eternal (rendered as statues?), watching. Inside: a single Ruby Heart
      on a pedestal, glowing with inner light. It pulses like a living thing.
      The muralists rendered it with obsessive detail—every facet perfect.
      Above it: Aurelyn's face, noble and sad. Below the vault: the bound
      Zhyraxion, imprisoned in the level above, unable to reach what he seeks
      most. The cruelty of the separation is the mural's central theme.

      Written in Crimson Order script, on the vault door itself:
      "AURELYN'S RUBY HEART.
      SEALED FOREVER.
      May this dragon rot in darkness for all eternity.
      May his desperation keep him company as centuries pass.
      This is mercy compared to what he deserves."

      The final mural is unusual: unfinished, deliberately incomplete.
      It shows a figure standing before the bound dragon. The figure's face
      is blank—waiting to be filled in. The figure holds Aurelyn's Ruby Heart,
      glowing. Before them branch six paths:
      - One path climbs (escape)
      - One path descends (deeper still)
      - One path transforms (becomes dragon)
      - One path destroys (shatters the heart)
      - One path speaks (names the dragon)
      - One path frees (redemption)
      The muralists seemed to be asking: what will YOU choose?

      In a hand different from any seen before—fresh, urgent, personal:
      "Six paths from the Ruby Heart.
      Six endings wait below.
      Zhyraxion is patient, but not kind.
      You are not the first to reach this vault.
      You may not be the last.
      Choose wisely. The dragon's fate is not yours to decide,
      but perhaps your own is."
