# Entity Configuration for Catacombs of Yarl
# This file defines all entities in the game including monsters, weapons, armor, and spells.
#
# Format:
#   - All entities support inheritance via 'extends' keyword
#   - Colors are RGB tuples [r, g, b] where values are 0-255
#   - Stats include hp, power, defense, xp, and optional damage/defense ranges
#   - Characters are single ASCII characters for rendering
#
# Inheritance System:
#   - Use 'extends: parent_name' to inherit all properties from parent entity
#   - Child entities can override any parent property by specifying it
#   - Nested objects (like 'stats') are deep-merged (child overrides specific fields)
#   - Multi-level inheritance supported (A extends B extends C)
#   - Circular dependencies are detected and prevented
#   - Examples: orc_chieftain extends orc, orc_veteran extends orc, etc.
#
# Monster AI Capabilities:
#   - can_seek_items: Enables item-seeking behavior (monsters pursue dropped loot)
#   - inventory_size: Maximum items monster can carry (requires can_seek_items: true)
#   - seek_distance: Maximum range for item detection and pursuit
#   - Item usage: Monsters with inventories can use scrolls (potions disabled for balance)
#   - Equipment: All monsters can spawn with and equip weapons/armor
#   - Failure mechanics: 50% scroll failure rate with interesting failure modes
