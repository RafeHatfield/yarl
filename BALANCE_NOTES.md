# Balance Adjustment Notes

## v3.3.0 - Continued Loot Balance (October 3, 2025)

### Issue Identified
**Playtesting feedback**: Still slightly too many healing potions. Getting close to right balance.

### Changes Made
Conservative adjustment - another small reduction:

**Healing Potions (Further Reduced):**
- Level 1: 55% → 50% (-5%)
- Other Levels: 28% → 25% (-3%)

### Rationale
1. **Small steps**: Another ~10% reduction rather than dramatic change
2. **Iterative refinement**: Close to the sweet spot now
3. **Maintain safety**: Still generous on level 1 (guaranteed 2 potions + 1 starting)
4. **Total reduction from original**: Level 1 now 50% (was 60%), Other now 25% (was 35%)

### Expected Impact
- ~1-2 fewer healing potions per playthrough
- Should feel "just right" - enough to survive, not flooded

## v3.1.1 - Loot Balance Tweaks (October 2, 2025)

### Issue Identified
**Playtesting feedback**: Too many healing potions dropping. Players have full inventory by floor 3, mostly healing potions.

### Changes Made
Conservative adjustments to avoid overcorrection:

**Healing Potions (Reduced):**
- Level 1: 60% → 55% (-5%)
- Other Levels: 35% → 28% (-7%)

**Other Items (Increased for Variety):**
- Confusion Scroll: 10% → 12% (+2%)
- Invisibility Scroll: 15% → 18% (+3%), now starts at level 3 (was 4)
- Enhance Weapon Scroll: 10% → 12% (+2%)
- Enhance Armor Scroll: 10% → 12% (+2%)

### Rationale
1. **Small steps**: Reduce potions by ~20% rather than dramatic cut
2. **Add variety**: Slight increase to utility scrolls makes loot more interesting
3. **Iterative approach**: Easy to tweak further if needed
4. **Maintain safety**: Still generous on level 1, just less flooding later

### Expected Impact
- Players will have ~2-3 fewer healing potions by floor 3
- Occasional utility scroll adds tactical decisions
- Still maintains the "generous early game" philosophy

### Next Review
After 5-10 playthroughs, assess:
- Are potions still too common? (reduce another 5% if yes)
- Are potions too rare? (increase 3-5% if yes)
- Is variety better? (players using more scrolls?)
