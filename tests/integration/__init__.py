"""Integration tests package.

This package contains tests that verify the interaction between
multiple real components of the game system. These tests use
actual game classes rather than mocks to catch interface
mismatches and integration bugs.

Integration tests are particularly valuable for:
1. Catching argument signature mismatches between systems
2. Verifying that systems work together correctly
3. Testing end-to-end workflows with real data
4. Ensuring refactoring doesn't break system interactions
