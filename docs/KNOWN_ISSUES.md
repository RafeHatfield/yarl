# Known Issues

## Victory Condition Screen Truncation
**Date Reported:** October 26, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 1 MVP  
**Severity:** Low (cosmetic)  
**Status:** Deferred to Phase 5 (Polish)

### Issue
The confrontation choice screen text is slightly too tall for the display area. Option "b" (Give Amulet) is partially cut off at the bottom of the screen.

### Impact
- User can still read most of option b
- Functionality not affected (can still press 'b' to choose)
- Temporary implementation for MVP

### Resolution Plan
Will be addressed in **Phase 5: Polish & Refinements** when all endings are implemented. At that time:
- Adjust screen height calculations
- Test with all 4 ending variants
- Ensure all text fits properly
- Consider dynamic height based on content

### Workaround
None needed - functionality works correctly despite cosmetic issue.
