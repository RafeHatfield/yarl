## Proposed Future Phases

### Phase 19: Monster Identity & Abilities

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (v4.10.0)

**Intent:**
Monster-specific abilities and tactical patterns to differentiate enemy types beyond HP/damage stats.

**Implemented Features:**
- **Orc Chieftain:** Rally aura (+2 damage to nearby orcs), tactical positioning
- **Orc Shaman:** Channeled Chant of War (+2 to-hit aura), interruptible by damage
- **Necromancer Variants:**
  - Base Necromancer: Raises corpses into zombies, hang-back AI
  - Bone Necromancer: Summons bone thralls from bone piles
  - Plague Necromancer: Raises plague zombies with infection
  - Exploder Necromancer: Detonates spent corpses (Phase 20 integration)
- **Lich (Arch-Necromancer):** Soul Bolt telegraph+resolve, Soul Ward counter, Command the Dead aura, Death Siphon
- **Wraith:** Life Drain melee (heals on hit), countered by Ward Against Drain
- **Troll:** Regeneration (2 HP/turn), suppressed by acid/fire damage
- **Skeleton:** Death-spawns bone pile (targetable by Bone Necromancer)
- **Corpse Safety System:** CorpseComponent prevents infinite raise loops

**Deliverables:**
- 12 new monster variants with unique abilities
- 26-scenario balance suite (all identity kits validated)
- Deterministic ability mechanics (no RNG where avoidable)
- Faction-aware AI and aura systems

---

### Phase 20: Status Effects & Combat Depth

**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS

**Intent:**
Introduce persistent combat effects and corpse explosion mechanics to create tactical depth.

**Completed Features (v4.11.0):**
- **Corpse Explosion Lifecycle:**
  - FRESH corpses: Created on death, raisable, NOT explodable
  - SPENT corpses: Created on re-death of raised entities, explodable, NOT raisable
  - CONSUMED corpses: Post-explosion, inert
  - Lineage tracking: Raised entities carry corpse_id for deterministic SPENT creation
  - Exploder Necromancer: Targets ONLY SPENT corpses
  - State machine prevents illegal double-use (raise+explode same corpse)

**Planned Features:**
- Damage-over-time effects (poison, bleed, burning)
- Movement penalties (slow, root, knockback)
- Action denial (stun, silence, disarm)
- Buff/debuff duration tracking
- Status effect resistance system

**Dependencies:**
- Status effect component framework (partially exists)
- Turn-based duration tracking (exists)
- Visual indicators for active effects (partial)

**Risks:**
- Status stacking may create degenerate strategies
- Bot AI needs sophisticated status handling
- Combat feel may become cluttered without careful UI work

---

### Phase 21: Environmental Hazards & Level Features

**Status:** PLANNED

**Intent:**
Make dungeon layouts mechanically meaningful beyond monster placement. Add traps, terrain effects, and interactive level features.

**Potential features:**
- Traps (spike, arrow, alarm, pit)
- Terrain types (water, fire, ice, darkness)
- Interactive objects (levers, pressure plates, portals)
- Line-of-sight obstacles (pillars, fog)
- Destructible walls

**Dependencies:**
- Tile property system expansion
- Trap trigger/detection framework
- Environmental damage system

**Risks:**
- Worldgen complexity increases significantly
- Bot pathfinding needs trap avoidance
- May require renderer updates for visual clarity

---

### Phase 22: Progression & Meta Systems

**Status:** PLANNED

**Intent:**
Layer meta-progression on top of single-run gameplay. Unlock systems, persistent upgrades, challenge modes, or run modifiers.

**Potential features:**
- Unlock system (start with limited gear/floors)
- Persistent upgrades (cross-run bonuses)
- Challenge modifiers (harder runs = better rewards?)
- Scoring system and leaderboards
- Achievement tracking

**Dependencies:**
- Save system expansion
- Unlock/progression database
- UI for meta-systems

**Risks:**
- May dilute core roguelike loop
- Balancing progression power creep
- Scope creep (meta systems can balloon)

---

### Phase 23: Content Expansion & Polish

**Status:** PLANNED

**Intent:**
Expand existing systems with more content rather than new mechanics. Focus on variety, balance, and player experience refinement.

**Potential features:**
- More monster families (demons, constructs, beasts)
- Expanded item pool (more weapons, armor, consumables)
- Additional spell schools
- Unique boss encounters
- Biome variety (different dungeon themes)
- Sound effects and music
- Particle effects and animation polish

**Dependencies:**
- All core systems stable
- Content pipeline efficient (YAML-based)
- Asset creation workflow (if adding art/sound)

**Risks:**
- Content additions may reveal balance issues
- Diminishing returns on variety without new mechanics
- Art/sound asset creation can be time-intensive

## Phase Management Notes

### How Phases Are Chosen

Phases are not strictly linear. The order reflects:
1. **Dependencies** (foundation before features)
2. **Risk** (validate core assumptions early)
3. **Feedback** (prioritize based on playtesting)
4. **Momentum** (capitalize on related work)

### When to Start a New Phase

Start a new phase when:
- Previous phase is stable and tested
- Clear problem statement exists
- Success criteria are definable
- Dependencies are satisfied

### When to Pause or Pivot

Pause or pivot when:
- Current approach isn't working (pivot)
- Blocking bugs emerge (pause, fix, resume)
- Playtesting reveals different priorities (pivot)
- Technical debt becomes inhibiting (consolidate)

### Phase Documentation Standards

Each phase should have:
- Problem statement (why)
- Goals (what)
- Deliverables (concrete outputs)
- Success criteria (how we know it's done)
- Key files changed (what/where)

Analysis docs (`PHASE_N_ANALYSIS.md`) live in repo root during active development, then move to `archive/` when complete.
