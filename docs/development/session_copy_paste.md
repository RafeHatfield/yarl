This will give the agent minimal but complete context to start Phase 4 without overloading it.

I'm working on "Yarl" - a traditional roguelike in Python. 

We've completed the Victory Condition story arc (Phases 1-5):
- Phase 1: Amulet pickup → Portal → Victory/Defeat system
- Phase 2: Entity dialogue progression (Curious→Enraged)  
- Phase 3: Ghost Guide NPC reveals Zhyraxion's true name
- Phase 5: Six distinct endings with dramatic cutscenes

Now I want to start PHASE 4: Environmental Lore

Read NEXT_SESSION_REQUEST.md for the full brief (everything you need in 5 minutes).

Here's the ultra-quick version:

## Phase 4: Environmental Lore (2-3 weeks)

Add atmospheric story clues through:
1. Signpost lore - add ending-specific messages to existing system
2. Murals & inscriptions - new examinable wall entities with backstory
3. Easter eggs - special interactions for observant players

Files to create/modify:
- config/signpost_messages.yaml - add new lore entries
- config/murals_inscriptions.yaml - NEW file for mural content
- map_objects/game_map.py - mural entity generation
- tests/test_phase4_environmental_lore.py - integration tests

## Context Available

- NEXT_SESSION_REQUEST.md - Minimal 5-min brief (complete specs)
- SESSION_HANDOFF_NEXT.md - Full strategic breakdown (if needed)
- VICTORY_CONDITION_PHASES.md - Phase 4 technical details (if needed)
- SESSION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md - Architecture & setup (if needed)

## Current Status

- 2432 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- All previous phases complete & verified
- Ready to execute Phase 4

## My request

Read NEXT_SESSION_REQUEST.md first. Then ask me what signpost/mural content you need written, or if you have questions about implementation. Don't load all the context files unless I ask or you need them.

Ready to start Phase 4. Let's go! 🚀
