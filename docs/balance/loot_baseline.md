## Balance Targets

| Band | Depths | Items/room | Healing/room | Rare/room |
|------|--------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| B1 | 1-5 | 5-8 | 0.7-1.2 | 0-0.1 |
| B2 | 6-10 | 6-9 | 0.8-1.5 | 0.1-0.3 |
| B3 | 11-15 | 8-10 | 0.5-1.0 | increasing |
| B4 | 16-20 | 8-10 | 0.5-1.0 | increasing |
| B5 | 21-25 | 8-10 | 0.5-1.0 | ~0.5 |

## Band Multipliers Applied

Located in `balance/loot_tags.py`:

```python
BAND_ITEM_DENSITY_MULTIPLIER = {
    1: 0.35,   # B1: ~35% of normal
    2: 0.45,   # B2: ~45% of normal
    3: 1.0,    # B3-B5: baseline
    4: 1.0,
    5: 1.0,
}

HEALING_BAND_MULTIPLIER = {
    1: 0.25,   # B1: 25% of normal healing chance
    2: 0.35,   # B2: 35% of normal healing chance
    3: 1.0,    # B3: baseline
    4: 1.1,    # B4-B5: slightly more healing for harder content
    5: 1.1,
}

RARE_BAND_MULTIPLIER = {
    1: 0.05,   # B1: almost no rings (5% of normal)
    2: 0.15,   # B2: very few rings (15% of normal)
    3: 0.5,    # B3: some rings (50% of normal)
    4: 0.8,    # B4: most rings
    5: 1.0,    # B5: full ring rates
}
```

## Baseline Results (2025-11-29)

### Testing Mode (with band multipliers)

**Note:** B1 (depth 4) still has testing template overrides that add guaranteed spawns,
inflating the numbers. B2-B5 use depths without template overrides for accurate measurement.

| Band | Test Depth | Items/room | Healing/room | Rare/room | Status |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| B1 | 4 | 18.00 | 3.79 | 0 | ⚠️ Template inflated |
| B2 | 10 | 5.48 | 0.59 | 0 | ✓ Close to target |
| B3 | 13 | 11.00 | 0.59 | 0 | ✓ Close to target |
| B4 | 18 | 7.61 | 0.61 | 0 | ✓ On target |
| B5 | 23 | 9.71 | 0.71 | 0 | ✓ On target |

### Normal Mode Baseline

Normal mode has much lower base spawn rates (1-2 items/room max), so these numbers
represent the floor for actual gameplay:

| Band | Test Depth | Items/room | Healing/room | Rare/room |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| B1 | 3 | 0.41 | 0.17 | 0 |
| B2 | 8 | 0.72 | 0.21 | 0 |
| B3 | 13 | 1.35 | 0.29 | 0.15 |
| B4 | 18 | 1.09 | 0.32 | 0.15 |
| B5 | 23 | 1.06 | 0.28 | 0.12 |

## Ring Band Restrictions

All rings now start at B2 or later:

- **B2+ (depth 6+):** protection, regeneration, strength, dexterity, searching, clarity
- **B3+ (depth 11+):** constitution, resistance, might, free_action, luck  
- **B4+ (depth 16+):** teleportation, invisibility, wizardry, speed

## Pity System

Pity remains unchanged and acts as a safety net:

- B1: Triggers after 6 rooms without healing
- B2: Triggers after 5 rooms without healing
- B3+: Triggers after 4 rooms without healing

With the healing multiplier reducing natural healing rates, pity will occasionally
trigger to prevent bad-luck streaks. This is intentional.

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test with band multipliers (testing mode)
python3 loot_sanity.py --bands --runs 5

# Test actual game balance (normal mode)
python3 loot_sanity.py --bands --runs 5 --normal

# Test specific depth
python3 loot_sanity.py --depth 10 --runs 5

# Filter to category
python3 loot_sanity.py --bands --runs 5 --category healing
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Testing templates:** Consider reducing `guaranteed_spawns` in early testing levels
   to allow proper B1-B2 balance testing
2. **Healing tuning:** May need to increase HEALING_BAND_MULTIPLIER slightly if pity
   triggers too often
3. **Rare progression:** Monitor ring drop rates in actual gameplay
